This is a web application using Sql-Server 2012. The script of the database is provided inside the project, with name "pcFacoty.sql".
This project is a naive approach for a pc factory management system. It provides employees management, departments management, authentication management, components management, producing products and recording sales records with dealers.
The web application uses servlet to provide wepages and includes javascript for login authentication. Also it uses angular js to fetch json files when adding a new component in /PCFactory/ServCompAdd
